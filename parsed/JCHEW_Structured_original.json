Jaundice is as a \nresult of the buildup of bilirubin - a reddish pigment resulting \nfrom haem metabolism in the body. It may or may not be as a \nresult of liver problem. The buildup of this yellow pigment \nmay be due to abnormalities in the formation, transportation, \nmetabolism and excretion. At times the level may not be \nclinically recognizable until it is high. Jaundice occurs in liver \nproblem, sickle cell disease, haemolysis, amoe biasis and \ntumour of the pancreas.\n2 .9 JAUNDICE\n\nPAGE  \n141\nH I STORY\nIs the infant unwell?

It spans at the ages of 10 to \n19 years.\nIt is subdivide d into two periods: early adolescence (between 10 - 14 years) and late adolescence (between 15 - 19 years). It should \nalso be noted that the term \ufb01young people\ufb02 covers the ages between 10 \u0152 24 years. True adolescence, therefore, is a transition \nthat may fall anytime between years and hence whenever health status or behaviours is being considered, \ufb01youths\ufb02 are quite often \nincluded among \ufb01adolescents\ufb02 leading to the addressing of both categories as \ufb01young people\ufb02\nIt is acknowledged globally that this group form an important part of any society and in Nigeria, young people aged 10 - 24 \nconstitute at least 30% of the population. It is also widely known that adolescence is a period of lea rning, excitement and overall \nincreased prevalence of high risk behaviours.\n \nexpectations. Transition to adulthood often involves period of stress, innovation, experimentation and disorganization.\nSome of the disorders with grave consequences amongst adolescents include unwanted pregnancy, rape, unsafe abortion, sexually \ntransmitted infections including HIV/AIDS, drug and substance abuse and other behavioural changes.\nTo reduce these consequences, it is important to have adolescents-friendly clinic where they are provided amongst other things, \ninformation on their health needs, counselling especially during crisis situations and have access to health services.\nThis section addresses the issues that are peculiar to adolescents. Other conditions are discussed in the child/adult section.\nPREAMBLE\n\nPAGE  \n7\nThe period of developm ent between the onset of puberty \nand adulthood (10 - 19 years), involves physical growth of an \nadolescent from a child into an adult.

Blood pressure usually increases with age as the blood vessels \n\nbecome less elastic. . Women tend to have lower blood pressure than men of \n\nthe same age. The normal systolic pressure for young adult is 100 - 120 mmHg \n\nand for older persons 120 - 140 mmHg. The diastolic pressure, which is the \n\nforce at which blood is returned to the heart from the circulation, is normal \n\nbetween 70 - 89 mmHg. High blood pressure is referred to as hypertension. \n\nHypertension is a very common cardiovascular disease affecting a lot of people. \n\nIt is thought to result from the narrowing of the blood vessels. The narrowing \n\ncauses the heart to beat harder in order to pump the blood.

It lasts for \nabout 280 days or 40 weeks. It is associated with physiological changes in the woman\u2122s \nbody which enable foetal survival as well as preparation for labour. The physiological \n\n\n\norgan reacts to the stimulus of pregnancy. The metabolic, chemical, and endocrine \n\nbalance of the body is also altered. Many of these changes are regarded as signs and \n\nsymptoms of pregnancy and can sometimes manifest as minor discomforts. However, \n\nwhen these conditions become persistent and severe, they become major disorders \n\nthat will require prompt medical attention. \nPrenatal or antenatal care (ANC) is the advice, supervision and intervention given to pregnant women in order to obtain and maintain a state \n\nof good health throughout the prenatal period. Prenatal care provides a platform for the health worker to discover any medical, obstetric, and \n\nmental problem the woman may have and determine if she can be able to deliver her baby safely. ANC provides opportunity to screen pregnant \n\n\ndomestic violence, for appropriate management and referral.\n\nThe 2016 WHO ANC model aims to provide pregnant women with respectful, individualized, person centered care at every contact and to \n\nensure that each contact delivers effective, integrated clinical practices (tests and interventions), provides relevant and timely information, and \n\noffers psychological and emotional support by practitioners with good clinical and interpersonal skills working in a well- functioning health \n\n\n\n\n\nemergency preparedness.\n\nPAGE\nHISTORY\n\u0141\n \nHow are y\nou feeling?\n\u0141 \nIf ill, what are your symptoms?\n\u0141 \nDo you have problems sleeping?

Labour \nprogresses in 2 phases, latent and active. Latent phase is characterised by cervical \n\neffacement (is 0-4cm dilated). In the active phase, cervical dilatation progresses much \n\nfaster. Labour is said to be in the active phase when the Os is 5 -10cm dilated.\n\n\nFirst Stage:\n It is the onset of strong painful regular uterine contraction that leads to \ndilatation of the cervix and appearance of show. This stage should not last for more \n\nthan 12 hours\nSecond Stage: \nIt commences from the full dilatation of the cervix to the expulsion of the baby, it should not last for more than l hour.\nThird Stage: \nStarts after the delivery of the baby to the complete expulsion of the placenta and membranes and the control of bleeding which \nshould not last for more than 30 minutes.\n\nFourth Stage:\n\nperiod in which complications can occur. \n\nPAGE  \nHISTORY\n\u0141\n \nHow man\ny months pregnant are you?\n\u0141 \nHow are you feeling?

This structured approachensures that Community Health Practitioners have easy access to the \n\ninformation they need to provide timely and effective care .\n\nexperience by providing visual representations of procedures, anatomicaldetails, andclinical signs. This visual approachnot only aidsin comprehension but also \n\nimproves retention and application of the information in real-world settings.\n BENEFITS OF ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE GUIDE\n1. \nEnhanced Understanding: Illustrations pr\novide clear and concise visual explanations of complex medical procedures and conditions, making it\neasier for health practitioners to grasp and r\nemember key concepts.\n2. \nImpro\nved Retention:Visual aids have been shown to improve memory retention. The combination of text and images helps reinforce learning and\nrecall of impor\ntant information.\n3. \nPracticalApplication:\n Illustrations can depict step-by-step procedures, helping practitioners to visualize the correct techniques and methods, which\nis crucial during emergency situations or routine car\ne.\n4. \nAccessibility: \nVisual content transcends language barriers and can be especially helpful in diverse regions where practitioners may speak different\nlanguages or dialects.\n5. \nEngagement: Illustrated guides ar\ne more engaging and can maintain the interest of practitioners, encouraging them to refer to the guide more\nfrequentl\ny and thoroughly.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPAGE  \n\u0001\ufb01\nWHAT YOU WILL FIND:\n\n1.\n \nClearl\ny Labelled Illustrations: Each illustration is accompanied by clear and concise labels that explain the anatomical details, procedures, or clinical\nsigns depicted.\n2.\n \nStep-b\ny-Step Visual Guides: Complex procedures are broken down into manageable steps with corresponding illustrations to ensure proper\nexecution.\n3.\n \nVisual Repr\nesentations of Conditions: Illustrations depict the visual characteristics of various health conditions, aiding in diagnosis and treatment\ndecisions.\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n\n\nexamination details to make informed clinical decisions and provide appropriate treatment. These protocolsdelineate the necessary actions and decisions required \n\nto manage a patient\u2122s symptoms effectively.
