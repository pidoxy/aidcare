The postnata l period begins immediately after the birth of a 
newborn, ext ending to six  weeks after delivery. This period is 
crucial for the survival of the newborn. Proper care must be 
taken to avoid complications including death. The post-natal 
care visits days are 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 21, 28. If the birth weight 
of the baby is normal (>2.5kg), at least three home visits are 
required on days 3, 7 and 14. - If the birth weight of the baby

HEALTH EDUCATION
Action/Activities to be Carried Out During Postnatal Care Visits
Discourage harmful traditional care practices and Counsel the mother against these harmful practices including the 
following: 
I.Cord care - Apply only Clorhexidine (CHX) and discourage the use of other substances such as toothpaste or Cow dung 
to the cord.
II.Colostrum is yellowish-coloured milk and should be given to the newborn because it protects the newborn from 
infection.
Promote Exclusive Breast Feeding
Exclusive breastfeeding means that a baby takes only breast milk with no additional foods or liquids, not even water (as 

begins. Baby should be breastfed 8 Œ 12 times per day and on demand. Tell the mother the advantages of breast milk 
which include: 
It is the best food for the baby as it digests easily
It protects newborn from infection
It promotes bonding between the mother and the newborn
Demonstrate good positioning and good attachment and discuss the importance of breastfeeding.
Promote Immunization: Newborns are particularly vulnerable to infections. Immunization is an important way to protect 
an infa nt™s health. They prevent illnesses and disea ses and failure to immunize may put the infant at risk of serious illness 
or even death 
Check immunization status and educate on the importance of completing all the child™s immunizations. 
Immunize newborns- Applicable for ONLY oral immunization Refer to the health facility for appropriate immunization 
Register birth (if not done already). 
Provide information on other scheduled visits Œ

Don™t smoke or use e-cigarettes. Don™t let anyone else smoke or vape around your baby.
Always put your baby in a rear-facing car seat in the back seat. Never leave your baby alone in a car.
While your baby is awake, don™t leave your little one unattended, especially on high surfaces or in the bath.
Never shake your baby Š it can cause bleeding in the brain and even death. I Call a friend, relative, or your healthcare 
provider for help.
Avoid sun exposure by keeping your baby covered and, in the shade, when possible. 
Counsel and provide emotional support. Reassure her that this is usually a temporary condition that happens to some 
women who have given birth. It sometimes helps if women know that feeling depressed following the birth of a baby is 
normal and many women experience these feelings. Try and talk to the woman™s family and explain to them the need for 
extra support at this time. Verify that she and the newborn are getting the care they need.

The visit of a newborn without complaint, is a preventative 
health appointment with the baby™s health caregiver with the 
goal of helping the baby to stay healthy in their earliest years, 
so they can grow into healthy adults. At this visit attention is 
focused on the total health and wellbeing of the baby, not 
limited to sickness, but based on the baby™s age and unique 
needs. 
This visit is very important and should always include 
screening for health problems, growth monitoring, and 
promotion. Health education about nutrition, immunization 
and protection from illness and other conditions as relevant 
to the family  is given. Mothers should be encourag ed to take 
 
two years of life and every 3 months thereafter until 5 years 
old, and once a year until the child reaches 21 years. These 
visits also provide opportunities to monitor mothers and talk 
to them about postpartum depression or anxiety.

Convulsion is a jerky movement of the arms and legs and 
twitching of muscles. It is very common in infants and children 
and can be caused by high fever from any cause, head  injury, 
tumour or sometimes infections of the brain or spinal cord. 
Muscle twitching due to tetanus or lockjaw should not be  
mistaken for convulsion. Tetanus often begins wit h tightness 
of the mouth, jaw and muscle twitching

Cough is usually a symptom of irritation or blockage of the air 

breathing is when the child is making extra effort to breathe, 

breathing can be seen by looking for chest in-drawing below 

chest in-drawing and fast  breathing indicate pneumonia. Fast 
breathing means a respiratory rate of 60 and above per minute 
for an infant less than 2 months of age; respiratory rate of 50 
and above per minute for an infant aged 2-12 months; and 
for, a respiratory rate of 40 and above per minute For a child 

breathing are pneumonia, asthma, mucus plug , enlarged 
adenoids and aspiration of a foreign body or heart diseases. 
Aspirin or kerosene poisoning can also cause fast breathing.

Diarrhea is the passage of three or more loose or watery 
stools in 24 hours. Passing 5 to 8 soft or semi-liquid stools 
per day is normal in exclusively breast-fed infants. Children 
with diarrhea may quickly become dehydrated and diarrhea 
in children often leads to malnutrition. The main danger in 
diarrheal diseases is dehydration, and it kills children more

or more. HIV/AIDS is a major cause of persistent diarrhoea.

Vomiting is the throwing up of the content of the stomach. 
Babies under six months often bring up little of their food 
immediately after being fed. This is normal. The common 
causes of vomiting are gastro-enteritis, meningitis, ear

Pallor is a ma jor sign of anaemia. Anaemia is reduced number 
of red blood cells or reduced amount of hemoglobin in each 
red cell (below 10 grams). A child can develop anaemia as 
a result of not eating adequate nutritious foods, malaria, 
malnutrition, parasites (hook worm or whipworm), infections 
and sickle cell disease. Anaemia can lead to death.

Jaundice is the yellow discolouration of eyes (conjunctiva) and 
skin due to increase bile pigment in the body. Jaundice is as a 
result of the buildup of bilirubin - a reddish pigment resulting 
from haem metabolism in the body. It may or may not be as a 
result of liver problem. The buildup of this yellow pigment 
may be due to abnormalities in the formation, transportation, 
metabolism and excretion. At times the level may not be 
clinically recognizable until it is high. Jaundice occurs in liver 
problem, sickle cell disease, haemolysis, amoe biasis and 
tumour of the pancreas.

caused by a decrease in food consumption and/or illness 
resulting in bilateral pittin g oedema or sudden weight loss. It 
is characterized by the presence of bilateral pitting oedema or 
wasting (low Mid Upper Arm Circumference or low Weight For 
Height). Acute malnutrition comprises of both severe acute 
malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).
All children under 5 years of age attending clinic should be 
examined and have their weight charted on the growth chart. 
Failure to ga in weight should alert the health worker to take

RUTF is the only food sick and thin/swollen children need to recover during 
their time in OTP. 
Always give RUT F before other family foods, such as pap, kunu, ogi, akamu, 
or other meals.
Always offer plenty of clean wate r or breast milk to drink while eating RUTF. 
Children will 
need to drink more water than normal.
Use soap and water to wash the child™s hands and face before feeding. Keep 
food packets clean and well stored.
Caregivers shall also use soap and water to wash their hands prior to feeding.
Sick children get cold quickly. Always keep the child covered and warm.
For children wit h diarrhoea, continue feeding. Give them extra food and

HIV/AIDS is caused by a virus, which infects human beings. 
AIDS is the disease condition resulting from low immunity. 
Babies born to HIV-infected women may become infected 
during pregnancy, delivery or through breastfeeding. At the 
same time, many babies who are not breastfed because of 
fear of HIV transmission may die from diarrhoea, pneumonia 
or other diseases (not related to HIV) because they are not 
protected by immune substances found in breast milk. Thus, 
HIVŒinfected mothers need to be well guided on how best to 
feed their babies. 
Ensure that more babies survive without becoming infected 
with HIV. Women can be given Antiretrovirals to reduce the 
chances of transmitting the virus to their babies. Babies born 
to HIV positive women are referred to as HIV exposed babies, 
a baby can only be said to be HIV positive after diagnostic

Skin disease is the presence of itchy or non-itchy raised lesions 
on the body. It may be due to poor hygiene, allergy, malnutrition, 
poor housing conditions as well as the environment. 
Some rashes can easily spread to other members of the family 
therefore, early referral and correct treatment is im portant for 
the welfare of the whole family. Some skin diseases affect the 
external skin (ringworm) or affect the skin internally 
(pyoderma). Others affect many parts of the body systems 
and are generally more important (measles, leprosy, diabetes, 
HIV/AIDS, Jaundice). Others are scabies, eczema, tinea 
vesicular, vitiligo, athletes™ foot, urticaria and contact dermatitis

A sprain is a stretching or tearing of ligaments - the tough 

the joints. 
The most common location for a sprain is in the ankle. Initial 
treatment includes rest, ice, compression and elevation. A 
strain is when a muscle is stretched too much and part of it 
tears. It is also called a pulled muscle. A fracture is a sudden 
break in the continuity of a bone causing deformity, pain, 
tenderness and loss of power or movement

The head contains the brain (with the organs for the sense of 
hearing, seeing, smelling and tasting). The bones of the head 
are very strong but sometimes a serious head injury may be 
caused by a fall or a blow to the head. Some signs of serious 
head injury are bleeding from the nose, mouth or ears, severe 
headache or unconsciousness. There also may be vomiting 
or the client may be confused. Any delay in referring a client 
with a head injury for proper medical treatment may cause 
permanent injury or death.

Worm infection is the presence of large amount of worm in 
the gut which causes discomfort to the patient.
Most children have worms. Ascaris (round worm) is the 
commonest. Heavy  round worm infestation produces 
abdominal pain, vomiti ng, constipation and sometimes 
obstruction of the intestine. Hook worm infestation is more 
common in rural areas  where heavy infestation causes 
blood in stool, anaemia,  malnutrition. Severe (whip worm) 
infestation causes bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, anaemia 
and prolapse of the rectum. Thread worms also live in the 
intestine and cause itching around the anus. Tapeworm is a

A urinary tract infection, commonly known as UTI is one of 
the most common urinary problems and is an infection that 
occurs in the urinary tract. This infection is most often caused 
by mic robes such as fungi, bacteria, and virus and involves 
the kidneys, ureters, urethra, or bladder. This condition can 
be very painful, and the consequences can get critical if 
the infection spreads to the kidneys. Children may present 
with abnormalities of the genitalia such as undescended 
testes,imperforate hymen, hydrocele, hypospadias, and 
hermaphrodite. Children may also present with painful 
micturition with or without discharge. Redness or itching 
of the genitalia may occur in genital infections. Patients 
may complain of discharge, pain and burning sensation on 
passing urine and blood in urine may occur as a result of 
schistosomiasis infection. Other causes of urinary problems 
are kidney disease and diabetes which can cause frequent 
micturition

Deformities of the arms and legs, if not corrected early could 
lead to permanent disabilities. The deformities or swellings 
may be due to bruises, fractures or a dislocation. It is 
importantto test for normal movement of the parts whenever 
there is a history of injury, swelling or deformity. Swelling of a 
joint may be due to a sprain of the tendons surrounding the 
joint. Sickle cell disease may also be a cause of pain in the

Changes in alertness and behaviour mean that the client does 
not act normal. He may be drowsy or unconscious or give a 
history of fainting. Big changes such as unconsciousness or 
delirium are easy to identify. Small changes such as drowsiness 
and decreased alertness are not easily noticed. If the client 
is not alert or is drowsy, it may not be noticed easily. If this 
happens, the client may not receive treatment and could 
come back later in more serious conditions. Therefore, careful 
observation of client is important.

An orphan is a child (0 Œ 17 years) who has lost one or both 
parents. A child is vulnerable if, because of the circumstances 
of birth or immediate environment, is prone to abuse or

Convulsion is a sudden, violent, irregular movement of a 
limb or of the body, caused by involuntary contraction of 
muscles and associated especially with brain disorders such 
as epil epsy, the presence of certain toxins or other agents in 
the blood, or fever in children.. It may also  be caused by injury 
and infection of the meninges, brain and spinal cord. Tetanus 
or lockjaw must not be mistaken for convulsion. It begins with

The head contains the brain, the organs for the senses of 
hearing, sigh t, smelling and tasting. The bones of the head 
are very strong but sometimes a serious head injury may be 
caused by a fall or a blow to the head. Other head problems 
include infestation with lice, dandruffs and headaches. Injuries 
and infections to the head are of great danger because of 
the large blood vessels and nerves which it contains and the 
possibility of damage to the brain.
Some signs of serious head injury are bleeding from the nose, 
mouth or ears, severe headache or unconsciousness. There 
also may be vomiting or the client may
be confused. Any delay in referring a client with a head injury 
for proper medical treatment may cause permanent injury, 
damage or death..

Eye problems, especially redness and discharge are commonly 
caused by injuries, chemicals e.g. soap and infections. The 
health worker must however be careful not to treat all eye 
conditions as if they were caused by infection. There are other 
more serious conditions such as pain and problems with vision 
which if missed, may lead to blindness e.g. lack of Vitamin 
A. Visual problems require correction. Cataract occurring in 
children may be a manifestation of Rubella infection

Ear Disorders 
Ear problems are diseases affecting the ear and are commonly 
caused by middle ear infection; usually with pain in the ear, 
dullness or redness of the ear drum sometimes with perforation 

bone behind the ear mas toid bone), because if thi s is tender 
to touch, it may mean tha t the child has mastoiditis. This is a 
danger sign. The other major complication is deafness which 
can be tested by clapping  your hands behind the child to see 
if he will turn and look.
Nose Disorders 
The nose is the organ for breathing and for the sense of smell. 
Disease or injury in the throat or sinuses can affect the nose. 
This could bring about watery discharge, mucous blood or pus 
from the nose. Also, injury to the nose can affect the throat. 
The health worker should think of a foreign object if there is 
discharge from only one side of the nose.
Throat Disorders 
A red throat may be caused by infection. It may be combined 
with nasal congestion and middle ear infection especially 
in young children. The tonsils normally enlar ge during

The common causes of abdominal pain are gastro-enteritis, 
malaria, appendicitis, rupture of the intestine, typhoid, sickle 
cell crisis and obstruction, e.g. strangulated inguinal and 
umbilical hernias. Constipation, worm infestation may also 
cause abdominal pain. Abdominal pain may lead to hardness 
or rigidity of the abdominal wall.
An abdominal hernia is when a part of the gastro-intestinal 
tract protrudes through a gap or weakness in the abdominal 
wall. Hernia can be found on the umbilicus, groin and scrotum.

Urinary and genital problems are diseases or conditions 
affecting the male or female urinary tract or genitalia. 
Children may present with abnormalities of the genitalia 
such as undescended testis, imperforate hymen, hydrocele, 
and hypospadias and may be hermaphrodite. They may also 
present with painful urination with or without discharge. 
Redness or itching of the genitalia may be due to infection.
Sexually active older children are especially susceptible to 
sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV/

may complain of discharge, pain and burning sensation on 
passing urine and blood in urine may occur as a result of 
schistosomiasis infection. Other causes of urinary problems

Deformities of the arms and legs, if not corrected early could 
lead to permanent disabilities. The deformities or swellings 
may be due to bruises, fractures or a dislocation. It is important 
to test for normal movement of the parts whenever there is 
a history of injury, swelling or deformity. Swelling of a joint 
may be due to a sprain of the tendons surrounding the joint. 
Sickle cell disease may also be a cause of pain in the arms, legs

Poisons are toxic substances which may enter the body 
through swallowing, breathing, absorption through skin or 
 
marked restlessness and pain. Small children are adventurous 
and may therefore be easily exposed to harmful substances.
Mothers should therefore be advised to keep kerosene, 
medicine, bleach, dye, alcohol and other harmful substances 
out of the reach of children. Kerosene and medicine should 
be labelled and must not be stored in soft drink bottles

Adolescence is the period of physical, psychological and social changes from childhood to adulthood. It spans at the ages of 10 to 
19 years.
It is subdivide d into two periods: early adolescence (between 10 - 14 years) and late adolescence (between 15 - 19 years). It should 
also be noted that the term ﬁyoung peopleﬂ covers the ages between 10 Œ 24 years. True adolescence, therefore, is a transition 
that may fall anytime between years and hence whenever health status or behaviours is being considered, ﬁyouthsﬂ are quite often 
included among ﬁadolescentsﬂ leading to the addressing of both categories as ﬁyoung peopleﬂ
It is acknowledged globally that this group form an important part of any society and in Nigeria, young people aged 10 - 24 
constitute at least 30% of the population. It is also widely known that adolescence is a period of lea rning, excitement and overall 
increased prevalence of high risk behaviours.
 
expectations. Transition to adulthood often involves period of stress, innovation, experimentation and disorganization.
Some of the disorders with grave consequences amongst adolescents include unwanted pregnancy, rape, unsafe abortion, sexually 
transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS, drug and substance abuse and other behavioural changes.
To reduce these consequences, it is important to have adolescents-friendly clinic where they are provided amongst other things, 
information on their health needs, counselling especially during crisis situations and have access to health services.
This section addresses the issues that are peculiar to adolescents. Other conditions are discussed in the child/adult section.

poor compliance Œ such as a patient taking a 7-day or 21-day 
course of doxycycline for chlamydial infections, including for 
lymphogranuloma venereum; 
reinfection Œ perhaps because sex took place, without a 
condom, with an untreated sex partner or a new partner; 
antimicrobial resistance Œ this is of particular importance in 
gonococcal and M. genitalium infections since antimicrobial 
resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium are being 
experienced with recommended treatments for these 
infections; and  the presence of an untreated infection Œ such 
as T. vaginalis and/or M. genitalium among men with urethral 
discharge treated only for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis

Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are infections that are spread through sexual intercourse. Common STIs include 
gonorrhoea, syphilis, herpes, genital warts, HIV/AIDS etc.
STIs can be painful and uncomfortable. They can also have tragic consequences such as infertility. Therefore, all cases of 
STIs should be adequately treated.

Injuries occurs in different part of the body tissues. They may 
be on the skin and/or deeper tissues which may be small or 
large and may include cutting of nerves and tendons. There 
could be wounds that have been for several days and have 
become infected or healing poorly; or Sores which are injured, 
infected or diseased part of the skin. Some may be Ulcers 
which are injuries in a bodily membrane. 
A fract ure is a break in the continuity of a bone. It is more 
serious if there is also a compound fracture, profuse bleeding 
resulting from wounds. There is an urgent need to stop 
bleeding to
avoid the patient getting into shock. Early cleaning and 
treatment of wounds or sores is important to prevent infections 
including tet anus. Adoles cent are prone to injuries, fractures, 
dislocations, wounds, bites from snakes, dogs, scorpions or 
humans.
Some injuries involve the head which comprises of the brain 
and the sense organs (for hearing, sight, smelling and tasting). 
Serious injury to the head may be caused by a fall or a
blow to the head. Some signs of this injury are severe 
headache, unconsciousness, vomiting, confusion, bleeding 
from the nose, mouth or ears. Delay in prompt care and/or 
referral of a patient with  head injury may cause permanent 
disability or death

The ear, nose and throat are linked and whatever affect 
one may affect the other. The ear is used for hearing and 
to maintain a balance, and any disease of the ear which is 
not urgently and adequately treated may not only lead to 
deafness, but also lead to inability to maintain balance.
Ear problems commonly caused by middle ear infection often 
accompanied by pain, dullness and redness of the ear drum 
 
Eustachian tube may spread to the middle ear. It is important 
to examine the bone behind the ear if it is painful (tender 
to touch); it may mean that the infection has spread to the 
mastoid bone. Testing an adult for hearing, one is advised to 
sit behind the client and ask him to repeat words or numbers 
you whisper to him.
The nose is the organ for sense of smell, and for breathing. 
When the nose is affected by disease or injury, it discharges 

The throat is the junction of the ear, nose and mouth. It 
contains the tonsils, pharynx, etc. Diseases affecting the 
throat can easily spread to the chest and brain.

COUGH
Cough
 is a rapid expulsion of air from the lungs in order to 

or other materials. Cough is a sign of irritation of the throat 

and wind pipe which comes suddenly. Causes of cough are: 

common cold, inhalation of dust, fumes and pollens, heart 

and lung diseases, cigarette smoking, etc. Cough sometimes 

helps clear the lung of accumulated mucus.  It is therefore 

not good to give cough suppressants unnecessarily when a 

patient has cough.

 VOMITING
Vomiting
 is the throwing up of the contents of the stomach. It 
may be due to illness or other conditions, for example, malaria,

 PALLOR
Pallor 
is a major sign of anaemia which indicates low haemoglobin level below 
10g/dl. The common causes of anaemia are bleeding from any part of the body, 
lack of iron or folic acid in food, hookworm infestation, sickle cell, and unspaced 

pregnancies, especially in women of child-bearing age. The place to look for 

pallor is the conjunctiva, the nail bed, the palm, the lips etc. Certain drugs like 

aspirin or phenacetin make anaemia worse, so we should not use them without 

good reason and never given to sickle cell and ulcer patients. Paracetamol 

should be used for such clients.

 JAUNDICE
Jaundice
 is the yellow discolouration of eyes and skin due to increase in bile 
pigment in the body. Jaundice results from the build-up of bilirubin-a reddish 

pigment resulting from haeme metabolism in the body. It may or may not be 

as a result of liver problem. The build-up of this yellowish pigment may be due 

to abnormalities in its formation, transportation, metabolism and excretion. 

At times, the level may not be clinically reorganized until the level is so high. 

Jaundice occurs in liver problems, sickle cell disease, haemolysis, amoebiasis 
and tumor of the pancreas.

 WOUNDS, SORES, ULCERS , FRACTURES & BITES
Wounds 
are injuries to the different body tissues. They are breaks in the skin 
and deeper tissues which may be small or large and which may include cutting 

of nerves and tendons. There could also be wounds that have been for several 

days and have become infected or healing poorly. Sores are injured, infected or 

diseased part of the skin. Ulcer is a break or discontinuity in a bodily membrane 

that impedes the organ of which that membrane is apart from continuing its 

normal function. The client could also have bites from snakes, dogs, scorpions 

or humans.
A fracture is a break in the continuity of a bone. It is more serious if there is also 
a cut in the skin and other soft tissues (compound fracture). If there is profuse 

bleeding resulting from wounds, there is an urgent need to stop bleeding to 

avoid the patient going into shock. Early cleaning and treatment of wounds is 

important to prevent infection and tetanus.

 EAR, NOSE AND THROAT 
DISORDERS
The ear, nose and throat 
are linked with each other and whatever affect 
one may affect the other. The ear not only helps us to hear but also helps 

us maintain our balance and any disease of the ear which is not urgently 

and adequately treated may not only lead to deafness, but also inability to 

maintain balance.
Ear
 problems are commonly caused by middle ear infection often 
accompanied by pain, dullness, and redness of the ear drum with drainage 

spread to the middle ear. It is important to examine the bone behind the 



infection has spread to the mastoid bone (mastoiditis). To test an adult for 

hearing, sit behind the client then ask him to repeat words or numbers 

that you whisper to him/her.
The nose
 is the organ for breathing and for the sense of smell. When the 



The throat
 is the junction of the ear, nose, and mouth. It contains the 
tonsils, pharynx, etc. Diseases affecting the throat can easily spread to the 

chest and brain.

 ABNORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE
Blood pressure 
refers to the force with which the heart pumps blood into the 
body circulation. Blood pressure usually increases with age as the blood vessels 

become less elastic. . Women tend to have lower blood pressure than men of 

the same age. The normal systolic pressure for young adult is 100 - 120 mmHg 

and for older persons 120 - 140 mmHg. The diastolic pressure, which is the 

force at which blood is returned to the heart from the circulation, is normal 

between 70 - 89 mmHg. High blood pressure is referred to as hypertension. 

Hypertension is a very common cardiovascular disease affecting a lot of people. 

It is thought to result from the narrowing of the blood vessels. The narrowing 

causes the heart to beat harder in order to pump the blood. Hypotension refers 

to low blood pressure and can lead to shock and organ failure.

 WORM INFESTATION
Worm infestation 
is the presence of large number of worms in the gut, 
which causes discomfort to the patient. Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm) is 

the commonest worm infestation. Heavy roundworm infestation produces 

abdominal pains, vomiting, constipation and sometimes obstruction of the 

intestine. Hookworm infestation is common in rural areas where heavy 

infestation causes blood in stool, anaemia and malnutrition. Severe Trichuris 

trichiura (whipworm) infestation causes bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, 

anaemia and prolapse of the rectum. Thread/pinworm (Strongyloides

 MANAGEMENT OF HIV/AIDS PATIENTS 
HIV/AIDS 
is of public health concern. It is responsible for increased 
number of deaths. It affects not only the patient but relations and 

friends. In recent times, with the introduction of Anti Retro Viral drugs 

(ARVs) the condition can be successfully managed while lives of the 

infected can be prolonged. The health worker therefore, should be 

able to provide care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS and 

those affected by it.

 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS [STIs (MALE) REPRODUCTIVE TRACT 
INFECTIONS [RTIs (MALE)]
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) 
are infections that are spread through 
sexual intercourse. Common STIs include gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, genital 

warts, HIV/AIDS etc. STIs can be painful and uncomfortable. The common 

syndromes are discharge, genital ulcer and lower abdominal pain. They can 

also have tragic consequences such as infertility. Therefore, all cases of STIs 

should be adequately treated.

6 .1
 PRENATAL (ANTENATAL) CARE
Prenatal period is the time between conception and childbirth (pregnancy). It lasts for 
about 280 days or 40 weeks. It is associated with physiological changes in the woman™s 
body which enable foetal survival as well as preparation for labour. The physiological 



organ reacts to the stimulus of pregnancy. The metabolic, chemical, and endocrine 

balance of the body is also altered. Many of these changes are regarded as signs and 

symptoms of pregnancy and can sometimes manifest as minor discomforts. However, 

when these conditions become persistent and severe, they become major disorders 

that will require prompt medical attention. 
Prenatal or antenatal care (ANC) is the advice, supervision and intervention given to pregnant women in order to obtain and maintain a state 

of good health throughout the prenatal period. Prenatal care provides a platform for the health worker to discover any medical, obstetric, and 

mental problem the woman may have and determine if she can be able to deliver her baby safely. ANC provides opportunity to screen pregnant 


domestic violence, for appropriate management and referral.

The 2016 WHO ANC model aims to provide pregnant women with respectful, individualized, person centered care at every contact and to 

ensure that each contact delivers effective, integrated clinical practices (tests and interventions), provides relevant and timely information, and 

offers psychological and emotional support by practitioners with good clinical and interpersonal skills working in a well- functioning health 





emergency preparedness.

MATERNAL HEALTH (L ABOUR AND DELIVERY )
Normal labour is the onset of strong painful regular uterine contraction and retraction 
resulting in the delivery of a live baby, without an injury to the mother or baby. Labour 
progresses in 2 phases, latent and active. Latent phase is characterised by cervical 

effacement (is 0-4cm dilated). In the active phase, cervical dilatation progresses much 

faster. Labour is said to be in the active phase when the Os is 5 -10cm dilated.


First Stage:
 It is the onset of strong painful regular uterine contraction that leads to 
dilatation of the cervix and appearance of show. This stage should not last for more 

than 12 hours
Second Stage: 
It commences from the full dilatation of the cervix to the expulsion of the baby, it should not last for more than l hour.
Third Stage: 
Starts after the delivery of the baby to the complete expulsion of the placenta and membranes and the control of bleeding which 
should not last for more than 30 minutes.

Fourth Stage:

period in which complications can occur.

 POSTNATAL DISORDERS
The postnatal period is 6-8 weeks after delivery. This is the time that lactation is well 
established and the return of the uterus and other reproductive organs to the pre-
gravid state. At least 3 postnatal visits for checkup should be encouraged to determine 

how the mother and baby are faring. This is also a special opportunity to screen 

involvement in substance use/abuse and signs of domestic violence, for appropriate 

management and referral.

INFERTILITY
Infertility is the inability of a couple to conceive after one year of unprotected regular 

sperm production, blockage of the sperm delivery system, injury to the testicle, 

disorders of hormone production, poor descent of one or both testes. Sometimes 



may be due to infections, poor knowledge of the fertile period, or irregular menstrual 

period, mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression involvement in substance 

use/abuse and domestic violence can also affect a couple™s ability to become pregnant. 

However, the Community health practitioner should be able to advise appropriately 

and take necessary action. This is also a special opportunity to screen mothers for signs 



abuse and signs of domestic violence, for appropriate management and referral.

Other causes include high blood sugar or diabetes, high cholesterol, or dyslipidaemia. Death from cardiovascular diseases can often be prevented if these 

risk factors are detected early, treated, and referred as appropriate.

Drugs that can be used in management of cardiovascular system 
Antiplatelet Agents: Help prevent blood clots. Aspirin and clopidogrel 

are examples.
Statins: Used to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular events. Atorvastatin and simvastatin are commonly 

prescribed.
Beta-blockers: Besides hypertension, they may be used for
conditions like angina and heart failure. Examples include metoprolol 

and carvedilol.
Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Similar to ACE inhibitors, 
they help manage blood pressure and may be prescribed for heart 

failure. Losartan is an example.
Calcium Channel Blockers: Used for hypertension and certain heart 
conditions. Amlodipine and diltiazem are examples.
